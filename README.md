# Overview

This github repository is to share common design patterns when it comes to solution architecture and the actual implementation behind it.

These designs will be hosted on AWS, but not all solutions will use AWS services that were designed specifically for our need. The goal is to understand how it works behind the scene's and going through implementation, not just using a provided service. There are also some technical patterns chosen simply because I did not want to bear the cost of having to use it.

All solutions are help on this website(still to be created) and has a UI to interact with the solution that was built behind the scenes.

# General Architecture

Below is the general architecture for how the website itself is hosted. It's very simple as it can be hosted directly with S3.
